## Features

- **Projects**: Manage multiple projects, each with its own workspaces, tabs, and files.
- **Workspaces**: Each project can contain multiple workspaces (contexts). You can add, rename, delete, and switch workspaces.
- **Tabs**: Each workspace supports multiple tabs, each with its own window/buffer layout.
- **Files**: Tabs remember their files, window layout, and cursor positions.
- **Session Management**: Automatically or manually save and restore the state of your workspaces, tabs, and files.
- **Visual UI Panels**: Navigate and manage projects, workspaces, tabs, and files with a floating panel UI and icons.
- **NerdFont Icons**: Visual indicators for all entities (project, workspace, tab, file, empty, etc).
- **Autosave**: Choose between automatic or manual session saving.
- **User Commands**: Save state manually with `:LvimSpaceSave`.
- **API Integration**: Public API for integration with other plugins and status lines.
- **Highly Configurable**: Icons, keymaps, UI appearance, and more.

## API Integration

LVIM SPACE provides a public API for integration with other plugins, status lines, and custom configurations.

### Tab Information API

```lua
local pub = require("lvim-space.pub")
local tabs = pub.get_tab_info()
```

Returns an array of tab objects for the current workspace:

```lua
{
  { id = 1, name = "main", active = true },
  { id = 2, name = "feature", active = false },
  { id = 3, name = "testing", active = false }
}
```

**Properties:**

- `id` - Unique identifier of the tab
- `name` - Display name of the tab
- `active` - Boolean indicating if this is the currently active tab

**Use Cases:**

- Integration with status line plugins (tabby.nvim, lualine.nvim, etc.)
- Custom UI components showing workspace tabs
- Building external tools that interact with LVIM SPACE

**Example with tabby.nvim:**

```lua
local pub = require("lvim-space.pub")
local tabs = pub.get_tab_info()

for _, tab in ipairs(tabs) do
    local hl = tab.active and active_highlight or inactive_highlight
    -- Use tab.name and tab.active in your tabby configuration
end
```

## UI & Appearance

- The UI uses floating windows with customizable borders and highlights.
- NerdFont icons are used everywhere for clarity.
- Empty panels display an icon and message from your language configuration.
- State is stored in a SQLite database for reliability and speed.

---

## Manual Save

If `autosave = false`, use

```vim
:LvimSpaceSave
```

to persist the full state (projects, workspaces, tabs, files, layouts, etc).

---

## Requirements

- **Neovim 0.10+**
- **NerdFont** enabled terminal (for icons)

---

## Troubleshooting

- If icons do not display, ensure your terminal uses a NerdFont.
- If state is not saved/restored, check your autosave setting or use `:LvimSpaceSave`.
- For bugs or feature requests, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
